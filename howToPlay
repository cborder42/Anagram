Hello There!

Rules of Anagram:
 - Try to form as many words as possible by rearranging the scrambled letters of one single word (the original word)
 - You can form words of any length greater than 3 letters
 - You will earn score for any correct entry, but will only move on to the next level once you enter the original word 
 - You begin with 5 lives and 5 hints. 
     - You will lose 1 life for every incorrect entry.
     - Invalid entries (less than 3 letters in length, using letters that are not given) will not result in deduction of lives.
     - Using a hint will show the first letter of the original word
 - Try to score as high as you can!
